Setup Instructions (Windows):

1. Open the UnrealEngine-4.14 folder.

2. Run Setup.bat as an Administrator. This can take a while depending on your download speed and the window will close when it finishes.

3. Run GenerateProjectFiles.bat as an Administrator. This is much faster and will also close when it finishes.

4. Open the newly created UE4.sln with Visual Studio.

5. At the top of Visual Studio, select the Solution Configurations dropdown between the Undo and Redo buttons and the dropdown that reads "Win64".

6. In the dropdown, select "Development Editor".

7. In the Solution Explorer on the right or left, right-click the UE4 project and select "Build".

8. This build can take a very long time depending on your computer. Wait until it completes, then close Visual Studio.

9. Open the DragonCrash-Unreal folder.

10. Double-click to open the DragonCrash.uproject file.

11. It should prompt you to build one or more .dll files. Press Yes.

12. This final build can take a little while, but when it finishes the Unreal Editor will open.

13. You are done.
