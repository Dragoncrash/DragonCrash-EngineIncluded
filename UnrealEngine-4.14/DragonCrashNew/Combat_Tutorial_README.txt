I made the level "Tutorial_Combat", "Tutorial_Mid_text" Widget, "Goat2", "Press_Shield_Slide1" Widget, and made changes to DragonMP.

I added 3 child actor components in DragonMP that is used in Tutorial_combat's 3_Combat_Tutorial_Shield Macro. All it does is shoot projectiles toward the Dragon itself.

Goat2 is just a sized up version of Goat.

Everything under Combat_Lesson in Tutorial_Combat is what I made and shouldn't interfere with anything else.

All I need is Ashwin's picture of the controller onto all of my slides except "3_Combat_Tutorial_Shoot_Slide". It should be covered either with just Ashwin's push or I need
to switch the "Create Widget's" class to the one with the picture.
